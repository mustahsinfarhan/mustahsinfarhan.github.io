# Urban Gardening
Living in an urban area, I witness the greenery diminishing daily due to various unavoidable factors. I believe urban gardening can offer a partial solution to this issue. This is why I plant diverse flowers, foliage, and even some vegetable plants in plastic containers. Doing so allows me to recycle containers I would otherwise litter, while their durability supports uninterrupted plant growth by eliminating the need for frequent replanting.

Along with some foliage, my planted flowers include Adenium, Petunia, Moss Rose, Portulaca, Periwinkle, Kalanchoe, Butterfly Pea, Ixora, Blue Days etc. I also planted some Garlics and Green Chillies.

I maintain the plants mostly on my own. I spray pesticides, remove weeds, and put manure into the soil. I water the plants, prune and trim the branches to make the plants healthy. I plant seedlings on a seedbed to provide them with special care. Sometimes plants get attacked by pests, especially mealybugs, then I separate the plants from the rest to reduce the outbreak. I really enjoy working on my garden.  

# Reading Books
In my spare time, I like to read books. My interests include science fiction, fantasy, detective and mystery, romance, action and adventure, suspense and thrillers and self-help genres. 

_Harry Potter_ series by J. K. Rowling is one of my favorite book series. I have read all 8 of the books multiple time both original and translated versions. In fact, _Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone_ was my first ever translated book to read that was written by a foreign writer, as I was only 9 at that time and could only read in my native language, which is Bengali. This book created an unforgettable immersion in my mind as a kid that later when I was in my university, I read all of the books of the series in original print. I was impressed again with the story telling, the bonding between family and friends, the display of wisdom and courage of different characters like Professor Dumbledore, Severus Snape and the list goes on.

My other favorite series are _The Hunger Games_ by Suzanne Collins, _A Good Girl's Guide To Murder_ by Holly Jackson, _Sherlock Holmes_ by Arthur Conan Doyle, _One of Us Is Lying_ by Karen M. McManus, _You_ by Caroline Kepnes and _Beg Bastard_ by Nazim Uddin.

Some favorite standalone novels include _Origin_ by Dan Brown, _1984_ by George Orwell, _Amazonia_ by James Rollins, _The Silent Patient_ by Alex Michaelides, _The Da Vinci Code_ by Dan Brown and _The Love Hypothesis_ by Ali Hazelwood.

_Atomic Habits_ by James Clear is one of my favorite self-help books. This book starts with a simple note that tiny changes in activity can result in massive improvements over time. The author lays out a simple 4 step layout for building any habit which are cue, craving, response and reward. Later in the  book the author described why each of these steps works out and how readers can implement these in their daily routines. I personally applied these rules in my daily life and built new habits such as indoor cycling 5 times a week, reading a chapter of the book everyday, watching english streamers to improve my listening skill, and so on.

I’ve read other self help books such as _Eat That Frog_ by Brian Tracy, _The One Minute Manager_ by Ken Blanchard and Spencer Johnson, and _The Ikigai Journey_ by Hector Garcia Puigcerver and Francesc Miralles. I’ve also read the biography of Elon Musk written by Ashlee Vance to understand his approach to innovation and entrepreneurship in the field of technology.
