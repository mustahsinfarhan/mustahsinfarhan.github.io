# Urban Gardening
Living in an urban area, I witness the greenery diminishing daily due to various unavoidable factors. I believe urban gardening can offer a partial solution to this issue. This is why I plant diverse flowers, foliage, and even some vegetable plants in plastic containers. Doing so allows me to recycle containers I would otherwise litter, while their durability supports uninterrupted plant growth by eliminating the need for frequent replanting.

Along with some foliage, my planted flowers include Adenium, Petunia, Moss Rose, Portulaca, Periwinkle, Kalanchoe, Butterfly Pea, Ixora, Blue Days etc. I also planted some Garlics and Green Chillies.

I maintain the plants mostly on my own. I spray pesticides, remove weeds, and put manure into the soil. I water the plants, prune and trim the branches to make the plants healthy. I plant seedlings on a seedbed to provide them with special care. Sometimes plants get attacked by pests, especially mealybugs, then I separate the plants from the rest to reduce the outbreak. I really enjoy working on my garden.  

# Reading Books
In my spare time, I like to read books. My interests include science fiction, fantasy, detective and mystery, romance, action and adventure, suspense and thrillers and self-help genres. 

**Harry Potter** series by J. K. Rowling is one of my favorite book series. I have read all 8 of the books multiple time both original and translated versions. In fact, **Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone** was my first ever translated book to read that was written by a foreign writer, as I was only 9 at that time and could only read in my native language, which is Bengali. This book created an unforgettable immersion in my mind as a kid that later when I was in my university, I read all of the books of the series in original print. I was impressed again with the story telling, the bonding between family and friends, the display of wisdom and courage of different characters like Professor Dumbledore, Severus Snape and the list goes on.

My other favorite series are **The Hunger Games** by Suzanne Collins, **A Good Girl's Guide To Murder** by Holly Jackson, **Sherlock Holmes** by Arthur Conan Doyle, **One of Us Is Lying** by Karen M. McManus, **You** by Caroline Kepnes and **Beg Bastard** by Nazim Uddin.

Some favorite standalone novels include **Origin** by Dan Brown, **1984** by George Orwell, **Amazonia** by James Rollins, **The Silent Patient** by Alex Michaelides, **The Da Vinci Code** by Dan Brown and **The Love Hypothesis** by Ali Hazelwood.

**Atomic Habits** by James Clear is one of my favorite self-help books. This book starts with a simple note that tiny changes in activity can result in massive improvements over time. The author lays out a simple 4 step layout for building any habit which are cue, craving, response and reward. Later in the  book the author described why each of these steps works out and how readers can implement these in their daily routines. I personally applied these rules in my daily life and built new habits such as indoor cycling 5 times a week, reading a chapter of the book everyday, watching english streamers to improve my listening skill, and so on.

I’ve read other self-help books such as Eat That Frog by Brian Tracy, which focuses on tackling the toughest tasks first, and The One Minute Manager by Ken Blanchard and Spencer Johnson, offering practical leadership strategies. I’ve also read the biography of Elon Musk, titled **Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future**, written by Ashlee Vance. His vision and accomplishments continue to inspire me in my own technological pursuits.

# Travelling
I like to visit new places to observe the natural and architectural beauty as well as different cultures. In fact, this inspired me to sign up to become a local guide for Google Maps as I can share my experience with others. I get to explore new areas while traveling and guide others on how to get there or what they expect the experience to be. 

Since my childhood, I lived in different northern districts due to my parent’s workplace changes. I observed the difference between certain city areas, the people and the weather which taught me about adaptation and growth.

Here are some places where I visited the past couple of years inside Bangladesh:
