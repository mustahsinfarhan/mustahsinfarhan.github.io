# Urban Gardening
Living in an urban area, I witness the greenery diminishing daily due to various unavoidable factors. I believe urban gardening can offer a partial solution to this issue. This is why I plant diverse flowers, foliage, and even some vegetable plants in plastic containers. Doing so allows me to recycle containers I would otherwise litter, while their durability supports uninterrupted plant growth by eliminating the need for frequent replanting.

Along with some foliage, my planted flowers include Adenium, Petunia, Moss Rose, Portulaca, Periwinkle, Kalanchoe, Butterfly Pea, Ixora, Blue Days etc. I also planted some Garlics and Green Chillies.

I maintain the plants mostly on my own. I spray pesticides, remove weeds, and put manure into the soil. I water the plants, prune and trim the branches to make the plants healthy. I plant seedlings on a seedbed to provide them with special care. Sometimes plants get attacked by pests, especially mealybugs, then I separate the plants from the rest to reduce the outbreak. I really enjoy working on my garden.
