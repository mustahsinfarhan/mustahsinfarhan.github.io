### Case Study for Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Capstone - How does a bike-share navigate speedy (December 2023)
In this case study, I analyzed bike-sharing data for one quarter and recommended promotional strategies that the company should implement to maximize profit. My main focus in the analysis was to understand how casual riders and annual members use bikes differently. By understanding these differences, my team could then develop strategies to convert casual riders into annual members.

The complete case study with visualizations is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/mustahsinfarhan/case-study-how-does-a-bike-share-navigate-speedy).

### Project for Google IT Automation with Python Professional Certificate Capstone - Automatic output generation (December 2022)
In this project, I developed a system that updates the catalog information with data provided by the fruit suppliers. When each supplier has new products for the store, the script automatically uploads the new products to the online store with the Images and descriptions uploaded separately using two different web endpoints. A report is generated automatically and sent via email to the suppliers. As this process is key to the business, I ran a script to constantly monitor the health of the system and send email alerts if any problem is detected.

### Featherweight Battle Bot (April 2022)
Designed a wedge shaped Featherweight (15Kg weight class) Battle Bot with an active weapon system. I implemented the electrical control systems for the robot and made some adjustments to integrate a powerful motor containing toothed spinner to use as a weapon during the conpettition. The wheel of the motor is customized to get firm grip on the surface. The wireless control system was cheap and easy to maintain. The body of the robot is designed such that it can withstand the impact of ramming of the opponents. A steel frame with load balancing structure is designed containing irregular shape which makes it difficult for the opponents to ram with huge impact.

### Human Rescue & Environment Monitoring Bot (October 2019)
#### Type: Academic (Team Project)
The objective of this project was to build a rescue robot which can assist in rescue missions as well as monitor the environment for temperature change and detection of toxic gasses. The robot was equipped with multiple sensors, a camera which can use a pan-tilt mechanism to observe different directions, processing equipment and an on-board first aid kit box. The robot has both autonomous and manual control and high visibility led lights to maneuver on different surfaces. The wheels are modified to get a firm grip on the surface and a siren is there to warn anyone if necessary.

A paper was published on this project which all the team members contributed equally. The full-text paper is available on [International Journal of Mechanical Engineering and Robotics Research](https://www.ijmerr.com/index.php?m=content&c=index&a=show&catid=191&id=1577)

### Soccer Bot V.2.0 (September 2019)
#### Type: Contest (Team Project)
Essonance 2019?


### Soccer Bot V.1.0 (July 2019)
#### Type: Contest (Team Project)
This soccer bot was created to attend the contest **Mecceleration 2019** organized by Islamic University of Technology, Gazipur, Bangladesh. The contest named _Robo Soccer_ featured 59 teams participating in a day-long competition, where bots competed against each other in a miniature soccer field. Me along with my team designed our soccer bot to appear bigger than average contestants to withstand the ramming of the competitor robots in the arena. I was responsible for the electronic control segments and my other team member was responsible for building the mechanical structures. A fan was placed on top of the robot to cool the electronics during the contest.
