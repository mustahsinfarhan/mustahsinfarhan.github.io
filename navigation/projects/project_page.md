### Case Study for Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Capstone - How does a bike-share navigate speedy (December 2023)
In this case study, I analyzed bike-sharing data for one quarter and recommended promotional strategies that the company should implement to maximize profit. My main focus in the analysis was to understand how casual riders and annual members use bikes differently. By understanding these differences, my team could then develop strategies to convert casual riders into annual members.

The complete case study with visualizations is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/mustahsinfarhan/case-study-how-does-a-bike-share-navigate-speedy).

### Project for Google IT Automation with Python Professional Certificate Capstone - Automatic output generation (December 2022)
In this project, I developed a system that updates the catalog information with data provided by the fruit suppliers. When each supplier has new products for the store, the script automatically uploads the new products to the online store with the Images and descriptions uploaded separately using two different web endpoints. A report is generated automatically and sent via email to the suppliers. As this process is key to the business, I ran a script to constantly monitor the health of the system and send email alerts if any problem is detected.

### Featherweight Battle Bot (April 2022)
Designed a wedge shaped Featherweight (15Kg weight class) Battle Bot with an active weapon system. I implemented the electrical control systems for the robot and made some adjustments to integrate a powerful motor containing toothed spinner to use as a weapon during the conpettition. The wheel of the motor is customized to get firm grip on the surface. The wireless control system was cheap and easy to maintain. The body of the robot is designed such that it can withstand the impact of ramming of the opponents. A steel frame with load balancing structure is designed containing irregular shape which makes it difficult for the opponents to ram with huge impact.
